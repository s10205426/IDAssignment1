# Your Project's Name
This is a Personal Portfolio Site for Ho Zhao Yan. He is Age 25, and is looking to advance his career in the IT industry. Throughout the course of his journey, he has gained numerous skills and knowledge that makes him a competent web designer, a job that he aspires to be. This project aims to help promote himself to his employers, giving them a good reason to hire him.

## Design Process
This website is made for any potential employers to seeking out those with knowledge that fit their job requirements. This allows Zhao Yan to present himself professionally to his employers and showcase his skills, potentially getting him hired.

## Features
The 'About Me' page gives a brief introduction to who Zhao Yan is and what he does.
The 'Education' page lets the user learn more about Zhao Yan's learning background.
THe 'Skills' page lets the user know about Zhao Yan's capabilities and skillsets.
The 'Contacts' page allow the user to get in contact with Zhao Yan for potential jobs.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - The 'Contacts' page allow the user to access Zhao Yan's social media platforms and possibly contact him for jobs.
- Feature 2 - The link to Zhao Yan's socials are in the form of the application's icon. This makes it more pleasing to the eye than to just add a url link.

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - Used as the coding software to code the website.

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    - Used to better improve on my code.

- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
    - Used to make the elements in CSS more consistent.

- [CSS]
    - Used for styling of the website

- [HTML]
    - The language that was used to code the website.

## Testing
1. Social Media platforms:
    1. Go to the "Contacts" page
    2. Click on the icon that corresponds to Zhao Yan's social media site that the user wants to look into.
    3. Takes them to a link of that site.

This project is catered to both desktops and mobile phones. On mobile, the website would shrink to the size of the phone through the use of media queries.

Unlike the desktop version where little scrolling of the page is needed, there will be more to scroll for mobile users if they were to view the entire page. 

During the first few commits, I actually planned on doing a One Page Scroll website, but later decided to change and implement multiple pages so that it is easier for the user to navigate. There were also a few test commits done to ensure that I fully understand how to upload my work into github (I apologise if it was confusing).

## Credits
- Credits to Youtube Channel 'Skillthrive' for teaching me the basics of implementing the navigation bar.
